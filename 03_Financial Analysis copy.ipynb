    "\n",
    "1. **Assets**: Assets represent the resources owned by the company, such as cash, inventory, property, and equipment.\n",
    "2. **Liabilities**: Liabilities are the obligations or debts owed by the company to creditors, such as loans, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.\n",
    "3. **Equity**: Equity represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. It includes contributed capital and retained earnings.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Income Statement** (also known as the Profit and Loss Statement) provides information about a company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses over a specific period. It helps assess the profitability of the business. The key components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Revenues**: Revenues are the inflows of assets resulting from the sale of goods or services.\n",
    "2. **Expenses**: Expenses are the outflows of assets incurred to generate revenues. Examples include salaries, rent, and utility expenses.\n",
    "3. **Gains**: Gains arise from transactions not directly related to the core business operations, such as the sale of assets.\n",
    "4. **Losses**: Losses occur when there are decreases in assets or increases in liabilities due to transactions or events.\n",

    "\n",
    "The three financial statements are interconnected, and their information is linked:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The net income from the income statement flows into the equity section of the balance sheet.\n",
    "- Changes in equity, such as additional investments or dividends, affect the balance sheet.\n",
    "- The net cash flow from the cash flow statement impacts the cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.\n",

    "The financial statements together provide a comprehensive overview of a company's financial performance, position, and cash flow, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.\n",
